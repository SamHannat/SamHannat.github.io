You know when you're hungry on campus and just want to get a bite to eat without waiting in a long line? Yeah, we made an app for that.

## The Problem
At our local uOttaHack Day, my team wanted to solve the problem of busyness. Often times on campus, it is quite random which food places and study spots are overcrowded. We wanted to develop an app that would allow us to make an informed decision on where to go before even leaving our seats.

## The Solution
To count the number of people in a location, we set up a node that counted nearby MAC addresses. By subtracting the addresses that correspond to university networking equipment, we can get an estimate of the number of people at the location. 

This data is gathered and sent to be stored in a database at set intervals. The web and mobile app then query the database to display the information to the users.

The mobile apps were built using Flutter and written in Dart. This allowed for fast prototyping and cross-platform support. 

## Conclusion
Our project ended up winning first place at the hackathon! I'm extremely proud of me and my team.
