I currently work as a software engineering intern for the Search team at Interset. There I help make the RESTful API using ElasticSearch and Java.   

Previously, I worked as a research intern for [Lewis Lab](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/jlewis/people.htm). I worked on a research project involving using neural networks to classify biological processes.    

Outside of work and school, I develop interesting projects. Most of the time, they revolve around machine learning. 

I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities in both industry and research. Don't hesitate to drop me a [line](mailto:shann053@uottawa.ca).
