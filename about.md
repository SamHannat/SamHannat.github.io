I worked over the summer as a software engineer intern for the Search team at Interset where I helped develop their RESTful API using Elasticsearch and Java 

Previously, I worked as a research intern for [Lewis Lab](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/jlewis/people.htm) on a research project involving neural networks classifying biological processes.    

Outside of work and school I develop interesting projects revolving around machine learning. I am also the [Developer Student Club - uOttawa Chapter](https://www.facebook.com/uodsc/?modal=admin_todo_tour) Lead and Founder. There I organize and run workshops relating to the Google Cloud Platform.      

My most recent resume is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFUDQU2NLNUerxmJ7T2-4AWfWGtxlB-o?usp=sharing).     

I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities in both industry and research. Don't hesitate to drop me a [line](mailto:shann053@uottawa.ca).
